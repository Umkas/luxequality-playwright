# Luxequality Playwright Test Assignment

Automated UI tests for a **Luxequality** test assignment.  
The project is implemented using **Playwright** and the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern.

## Assignment Description
The task was to implement **9 test cases** for [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/), covering basic user flows:  
- login / logout,  
- working with products,  
- cart operations,  
- checkout process,  
- menu navigation,  
- verifying footer social links.

## Implemented Test Cases

9. **Cart.009** — checkout with an empty cart 🚨 **(BUG: this test is expected to fail)**
